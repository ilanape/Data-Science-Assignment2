# Data-Science-Assignment2

- Classification of handwritten digits from the MNIST data set.

- This project uses the unsupervised learning algorithm Kmeans to classify the images, therefore, for learning the classifier it uses only the training data set.

- The program applies the Kmeans clustering algorithm using k clusters, first using random initialization (random values in [0,1]) and then using a single image that found from each label.

- The program determines which of the clusters corresponds to which digit and assigns a digit to a cluster using the most common label in it.

- Estimation of the label using closest centroid.
